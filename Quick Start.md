# 🚀 Deployment Guide: Movie Discovery Engine

This guide explains how to set up and run the Movie Discovery Engine on a new computer.

## 📋 1. Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the new machine has:
* **Python 3.10+** installed.
* The project files: `gui_app.py` and `requirements.txt`.
* A stable internet connection.

## 🛠️ 2. Step-by-Step Setup

### **Step A: The Environment File**
1. Create a new file in the project folder named `.env`.
2. Open it with a text editor and add your TMDB token:
   ```text
   TMDB_TOKEN=your_api_token_here

### **Step B: Create a Virtual Environment**
This keeps the project libraries isolated from the rest of the computer.
* Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
* Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

### **Step C: Install Required Libraries**
Activate the environment and use the `requirements.txt` file to install everything at once.
    
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🏃 3. Creating a "One-Click" Launcher
Instead of typing commands every time, create a Windows Batch script to launch the app instantly.
* Open Notepad.
* Paste the following code:
    
    ```Code snippet
    @echo off
    title Movie Engine Launcher
    :: Ensure we are in the right folder
    cd /d "%~dp0"
    :: Activate the environment and run the app
    call venv\Scripts\activate
    python gui_app.py
    pause

Save the file as `run_app.bat` inside your project folder.

## 🎮 4. How to Use the App

| Feature | How it works |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Recommendation Mode`** | Enter a "Base Movie." The engine finds similar movies but filters out sequels so you find new favorites. |
| **`Discovery Mode`** | Leave "Base Movie" empty and use Year/Genre to browse the top-rated hits of that category. |
| **`Why Recommended?`** | Click any movie in the list to see the "Shared DNA" (genres) between your input and the result. |
| **`Action Buttons`** | Use the detail panel to watch trailers on YouTube or save titles to your `watchlist.txt`. |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
* Empty Results? Check your spelling or try a more common movie title.
* No Images? Ensure you are connected to the internet.
* Encoding Errors? If requirements.txt looks like gibberish, ensure it was saved in UTF-8 or ASCII format, not UTF-16.
